<h2>Criteria In Detail</h2>

<h3 id="strong_hiring_signals">It generates strong hiring signals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A coding challenge for hiring purposes should give you strongly actionable information to help make a hiring
        decision
    </li>
    <li>Think carefully about what skills it is most important for a candidate to demonstrate, and then design your
        challenge specifically to test those skills
    </li>
    <li>You will usually obtain the most relevant results if you organize your test into separate but complimentary
        tasks, each focusing on a particular technique or problem
    </li>
    <li>Prioritize what is most important to the role you're hiring for. Respect your candidates' time. Only ask them to
        work on things that are actually important to you.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="defined_assessment_criteria">The assessment criteria are well-defined</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Be explicit about what criteria you are using to assess a candidate</li>
    <li>Be explicit about what does not form part of the assessment; e.g. don't have candidates spend time on writing
        tests if you don't consider it an important part of the exercise
    </li>
    <li>Make sure this is communicated to the candidate as part of the challenge's instructions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="expected_duration">An expected duration is communicated</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It is important for a candidate to know roughly how long they should be spending on a coding challenge</li>
    <li>Knowing this allows applicants to schedule out and manage an appropriate period of time - or walk away if they
        choose
    </li>
    <li>It also allows engineers to sanity check their progress. If they've spent a day on a two hour test, it might be
        time to reach out for help
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="clear_scoping">Scoping is clear</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All scope should be captured in written instructions that can be referred to during the course of the test</li>
    <li>A candidate should be clear about what they're supposed to be doing; don't allow figuring that out to become
        part of the test
    </li>
    <li>Communicate specific exclusions on out-of-scope tasks if required</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="time_limits">A time limit has been considered</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Always consider application of time limits carefully. The decision to apply a time limit should always be driven
        by what is best for your candidates
    </li>
    <li>In general, time limits are a good idea for shorter screening tests (e.g. 30 minutes); they can prevent an
        unsuitable candidate spending hours pursuing a role they are not qualified for
    </li>
    <li>Time limits may be inappropriate for longer challenges completed in non-continuous sessions</li>
    <li>Any time limit applied should allow successful candidates to complete the test with plenty of time to spare.
        Don't allow time pressure to compromise your ability to assess a candidate's skills
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="starter_project">A starter project is provided where appropriate</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Where possible, give candidates a starter project containing the files required to install dependencies, run
        tests and execute their code
    </li>
    <li>Provide explicit instructions for setting up and running the project</li>
    <li>Supply as many tools as possible to give the candidate feedback on their own progress in line with your own
        assessment criteria. E.g. tests, linting configuration
    </li>
    <li>This may not be possible for some challenges which are language-agnostic. If this is the case, consider whether
        your test meets the other checklist guidelines carefully
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="submission_process">The submission process is documented</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tell candidates how to return their completed code to you. It should be obvious, but it is often overlooked</li>
    <li>This can be accomplished in a number of ways (email attachments, Google Drive uploads, public PRs, purpose-built
        services). Try to make it as low friction as possible
    </li>
    <li>If necessary, instruct candidates about which files and directories should be present in the returned submission
        (e.g. include the .git folder, but exclude node_modules)
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="evaluated_in_house">It has been evaluated by in-house engineers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Always evaluate your coding challenge on your in-house engineers. Try to mimic the process which your candidates
        go through as closely as possible
    </li>
    <li>Record how long it takes to complete in order to provide a better idea of how long it should take your
        candidates
    </li>
    <li>Use the opportunity to collect feedback and improve the instructions and scoping of your challenges</li>
</ul>
