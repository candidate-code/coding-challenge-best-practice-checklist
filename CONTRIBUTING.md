# Contributing

We'd welcome community involvement in improving both the checklist and the documentation around it.

This set of contribution guidelines is kept intentionally light; should extra documentation be needed, we'll add to it as we go along.

* If you'd like to start a discussion, please raise an issue on GitHub
* Suggested contributions are welcomed through pull requests:
    * Open up a PR that contains the change you'd suggest making
    * If it's a change beyond a brief spelling or grammar correction, please briefly describe your rationale so the community can comment and discuss more effectively
    * Please attempt to keep any content short and to the point
    * Please stick to the established format
* The content of the article itself is in `checklist.html`
* In future, this might be migrated to a more documentation-friendly format. For now, please bear with us.

Note we're explicitly considering discussions about whether coding challenges are appropriate to use for any given situation out of scope for this checklist. That's for another article/checklist/document somewhere.

 ## Versioning

We're attempting to manage this through a variation of semver. Major/minor/patch correspond (roughly) to the following levels of change:

* Major - removed, changed or added top level items on the checklist
* Minor - "non-breaking" enhancements to what's there; would the changes under consideration ever cause a 'passing' coding challenge to fail, or visa-versa? If so, it's probably a major change instead
* Patch - spelling corrections, grammar fixes, improvements and clarifications that do not otherwise change meaning substantially

At the time of writing, we're still at version v0.1.0 - until v1.0.0 is published, breaking changes may happen at any version number.

We look forward to seeing contributions from you - thanks in advance!
