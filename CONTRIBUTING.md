# Contributing

We'd welcome community involvement in improving both the checklist and the documentation around it.

This set of contribution guidelines is kept intentionally light. Should extra documentation be needed we'll add it as required.

* If you'd like to just start a discussion, please raise an issue on GitHub
* Suggested contributions are welcomed through pull requests:
    * Open up a PR that contains the change you'd suggest making
    * If it's a change beyond a brief spelling or grammar correction, please briefly describe your rationale so the community can comment and discuss more effectively
    * Attempt to keep any content short and to the point
    * Please stick to the established format as far as possible
    * Bear in mind the 'overall goals' documented below
* The content of list itself is in `checklist.html`
* `checklist.html` will be merged into the Candidate Code site and published on a regular basis should changes occur
* In future, the html might be migrated to a more documentation-friendly format. For now, please bear with us.

Note: Coding challenges are not appropriate tools to use in all circumstances. We're explicitly considering those discussions out of scope for this checklist. That will be for another article/checklist/document in the future.

## Overall Goals

* We want to vastly improve the experience of engineers taking these tests
* We want to maximize the utility of coding challenges for engineers working in recruitment roles
* We're aiming for a concise list of pass/fail criteria
    * It should be easy to decide whether your coding challenge meets any individual criterion or not
    * Avoid conditional guidelines if at all possible - they're harder to reason about

## Versioning

We're attempting to manage this through a loosely applied variation of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Major/minor/patch versions correspond (roughly) to the following levels of change:

* Major - removed, changed or added top level items on the checklist
* Minor - "non-breaking" enhancements to what's there; would the changes under consideration ever cause a 'passing' coding challenge to fail, or visa-versa? If so, it's probably a major change instead
* Patch - spelling corrections, grammar fixes, improvements and clarifications that do not otherwise change meaning substantially

At the time of writing, we're still at version v0.1.0 - until v1.0.0 is published, breaking changes may happen at any version number.

We look forward to seeing contributions from you - thanks in advance!
